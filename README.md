A Python/Flask web app that ingests real-time Battlezone: Combat Commander game sessions, enriches them with Steam/GOG metadata, mirrors all assets, provides a modern live GameWatch UI, and stores historical analytics with provider-agnostic authentication.

WIP: attempting to create a Team Picker which requires both commanders be signed into the site, and allows them to pick from the list of players within their game. 

NOTE: this is abandoned; anyone who wants to continue it is free to use this code however they please.
